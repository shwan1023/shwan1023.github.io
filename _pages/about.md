Hi there! Welcome to my homepage!

I am **Sihao Wan**, an incoming graduate student at the College of Intelligence and Computing (CIC), Tianjin University. In September 2025, I will begin my master's degree under the supervision of Professor Bo Wang at Tianjin University. The same year, I will receive my bachelor's degree from the College of Computer Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology.

Research Interests
------

- My technical interests span AI, hardware-software co-design, IoT, and algorithm development. I have developed several DIY projects that offer practical solutions and value to society.
- In the past, I have worked on topics such as Computer Vision (CV), Time Series Forecasting (TSF), Vehicular Networks (V2X), and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). These projects have been driven by a mix of interest and hands-on experience over the years.
- Currently, my primary research focus is on **Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Agents**. I am also intrigued by Computational Psychology, Social Computing, Personalized Recommendation Systems, and Intelligent Dialogue Systems.
- In the future, I aspire to combine academic research with practical engineering to continue creating products that deliver real-world social impact.
